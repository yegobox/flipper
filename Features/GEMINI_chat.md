# Gemini Chat UI Improvements

This document outlines the changes made to the AI chat screen to improve its UI and responsiveness.

## Changes

1.  **Added Back Button:** A back button has been added to the header of the chat screen, allowing users to easily navigate back to the previous screen.
2.  **Responsive Layout:** The layout of the chat screen has been refactored to be more responsive, ensuring it looks good on both mobile and desktop devices. This was achieved by using a `LayoutBuilder` to dynamically adjust the UI based on the screen size.
3.  **UI Enhancements:** Minor UI tweaks have been made to improve the overall look and feel of the chat screen.
4.  **Intelligent Copy Button:** The copy functionality has been consolidated into a single, intelligent button. If the message contains a visualized graph, clicking the copy button will capture the graph as a PNG image and copy it to the clipboard. If the message is plain text, the text content will be copied to the clipboard. This functionality utilizes the `pasteboard` package for more reliable image copying across platforms.

## üß™ UI / UX Test Report *(Current Observations)*

### VERIFIED ASPECT
1. **Very Responsive**: According to screen resolution

### Key Issues & Recommendations

1. **Navigation & Controls**: Add *Back* and *Cancel* buttons in multi-step flows.
2. **Transaction Feedback**: Introduce optimistic UI states and server idempotency keys.
3. **Irreversible Actions**: Implement confirmation steps and undo options.
4. **API Performance**: Reduce coupling, batch requests, and add caching.

### Roadmap Priorities

1. Implement reversal and escape controls.
2. Optimize transaction latency and feedback.
3. Standardize API error handling and timeouts.
4. Add instrumentation and performance metrics.
5. Improve accessibility and UX consistency.


## Missing Steps (Gap Analysis)

Below are key setup and workflow steps present in `release.yml` but missing or incomplete in the current README:

- **Git Submodules:**  
  All jobs use `submodules: recursive` and run `git submodule update --init`. The README only shows a plain `git clone` and does not mention using `--recurse-submodules` or updating submodules after cloning.

- **Toolchain Versions:**  
  The workflow specifies Flutter `3.32.6`, Java JDK `17`, Node `20` (for Firebase deploy), and Ruby `3.0` (for Fastlane). The README does not provide version guidance, which can lead to local version mismatch issues.

- **Melos Bootstrap Sequence:**  
  The workflow always runs `dart pub global activate melos 6.3.2` followed by `melos bootstrap`. The README shows activation but does not stress the required version or the need to repeat this per clean build.

- **Secrets / Generated Config Files:**  
  The workflow configures missing files by echoing secrets into multiple paths: `config.dart`, `secrets.dart`, `firebase_options.dart`, `amplifyconfiguration.dart`, `team-provider-info.json`, and `web/index.html`. The README only mentions two files (`secrets.dart`, `firebase_options.dart`), with others missing and no placeholder instructions.

- **Amplify Support Files:**  
  Files like `amplify/team-provider-info.json` and `amplifyconfiguration.dart` are handled in the workflow but not mentioned in the README.

- **Web Index Injection:**  
  The workflow creates `apps/flipper/web/index.html` from a secret `$INDEX`, which is not documented in the README.

- **Code Generation:**  
  Packages use tools like `build_runner`, `freezed`, and `dart_mappable` for code generation before tests/builds. The README does not show the code generation command.

- **Running Tests:**  
  The workflow runs tests with `flutter test --dart-define=FLUTTER_TEST_ENV=true` for dashboard and integration tests. The README lacks a section on running tests or using the `--dart-define` flag.

- **Integration Tests (Windows):**  
  The workflow uses `integration_test/smoke_windows_test.dart` on the Windows runner, which is not documented in the README.

- **Windows Packaging:**  
  The workflow runs `dart run msix:create` (for debug and store), extracts version info, and installs certificates. The README does not include instructions for building Windows MSIX packages or installing certificates.

- **Fastlane / Android Release Lanes:**  
  The workflow supports lane choices like `beta`, `promote_to_production`, and `production`, with `internal` as default elsewhere. The README does not provide guidance on lanes or required keystore/service JSON placeholders.

- **Firebase Hosting Deploy:**  
  The workflow uses the Firebase action after building the web app, requiring Node and a service account secret. The README does not mention web deployment requirements.

- **Environment Variables / Secrets Naming:**  
  The workflow uses variables such as INDEX, CONFIGDART, SECRETS, FIREBASEOPTIONS, AMPLIFY_CONFIG, AMPLIFY_TEAM_PROVIDER, POSTHOG_API_KEY, DB_URL, DB_PASSWORD, etc. The README only lists ‚ÄúAPI keys‚Äù in general terms.

- **Branch Naming Conventions:** 
 
  Workflow triggers on branches named `feature-*`, `hotfix-*`, `bugfix-*`, `request-enhancment`, `shifts`, as well as `dev` and `main`. This is not documented in the README and would be helpful for contributors

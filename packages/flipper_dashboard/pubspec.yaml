  #  the licence is for company less than 1M in revenue and have not received 3M in outside source
  # Meaning I am using this package for now to speed up the process of development
  # if we hit that limit, we will have to switch to paid package or implement some functionality
  # by ourself. but for esence of time I do not want to wast time

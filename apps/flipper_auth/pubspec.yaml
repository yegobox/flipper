# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as
# versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at
# https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while
# build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.

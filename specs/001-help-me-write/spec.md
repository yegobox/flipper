## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to log in using a PIN and then complete a second authentication step so that I can securely access my dashboard.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is on the login screen, **When** they enter their correct PIN, **Then** the system prompts them to choose a second authentication method (SMS or Authenticator).
2. **Given** the user has chosen SMS authentication, **When** they enter the correct OTP received via text message, **Then** they are logged in and see the dashboard.
3. **Given** the user has chosen Authenticator authentication, **When** they enter the correct code from their authenticator app, **Then** they are logged in and see the dashboard.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an incorrect PIN is entered?
- What happens when an incorrect SMS OTP or Authenticator TOTP is entered?
- How does the system behave if the API call to verify the PIN fails?
- How does the system behave if the API call to send an SMS OTP fails?
- What is the process if a user's account does not have a phone number or authenticator app registered? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Onboarding/setup for 2FA is not described]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST present a field for the user to enter a PIN.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST validate the entered PIN via an API call.
- **FR-003**: Upon successful PIN validation, the system MUST prompt the user to select either SMS (OTP) or Authenticator (TOTP) as a second factor.
- **FR-004**: If SMS is chosen, the system MUST trigger an API call to send an OTP to the user's registered phone number.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST provide a field for the user to enter the received OTP or the TOTP from their authenticator app.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST validate the entered OTP/TOTP.
- **FR-007**: Upon successful validation of the second factor, the system MUST grant the user access and display a simple dashboard.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST display a clear error message if the PIN, OTP, or TOTP is incorrect.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST handle and inform the user of any API-related errors during the login process.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User Account**: Represents the user. Must be associated with a PIN and have methods for both SMS and TOTP authentication.
- **Dashboard**: A simple screen displayed after a successful login. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: The content and functionality of the dashboard are not specified].

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started: Repository Setup

This repository is a monorepo managed with [Melos](https://melos.invertase.dev/).

This section aligns local development with our CI/CD (`release.yml`). **If you cloned the repository before these steps, please repeat them.**

### 1. Prerequisites & Toolchain Versions

| Tool               | Required Version        | Notes                                                                |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Flutter            | **3.32.6** (stable)     | Match CI to avoid build/test drift. (Update here *first* before CI.) |
| Dart               | Bundled with Flutter    | Ensure `dart --version` matches Flutter SDK.                         |
| Java JDK           | **17** (Zulu / Temurin) | Required for Android and some tooling.                               |
| Ruby               | **3.0.x**               | For Fastlane (Android release lanes).                                |
| Node.js            | **20.x LTS**            | Used for Firebase Hosting deploy and scripts.                        |
| Melos              | **6.3.2**               | Monorepo orchestration (pinned version).                             |
| Git                | >= 2.40                 | Needed for submodules and hooks.                                     |
| Android SDK / NDK  | Latest stable           | Required for Android builds.                                         |
| PowerShell 7 (Win) | Optional                | For advanced scripting.                                              |

> **Why pin versions?** Divergent build artifacts and flaky tests occur when contributors use unverified toolchains. Always upgrade deliberately.

### 2. Clone With Submodules

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/yegobox/flipper.git
cd flipper

# If already cloned without submodules
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### 3. Activate Melos (Pinned Version)

```bash
dart pub global activate melos 6.3.2
```

### 4. Bootstrap the Monorepo

```bash
melos bootstrap
```

If dependencies fail to resolve:

```bash
melos clean
melos bootstrap
```

### 5. Git Hooks

```bash
git config core.hooksPath hooks
```

### 6. Code Generation

```bash
melos run build
```

### 7. Configure Local Secrets & Config

For security reasons, some configuration files containing sensitive information are not included in the repository. You will need to create them manually.

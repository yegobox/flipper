# Flipper

Flipper is a service that provides a fully one business software, data encryption
platform for you business and personal use. 

This monorepo contains all our source code - the client apps (iOS / Android /
F-Droid / Web / Linux / macOS / Windows) for both the products (and more planned
future ones!), and the server that powers them.

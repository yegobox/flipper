# Introduction
# Notice
    The flipper and all related material in this repository are not public and none should use flipper,flipper source code without a conset from yegobox.
Bootstrap and package your project with Angular 9 and Electron 8 (Typescript + SASS + Hot Reload) for creating Desktop applications.

Currently runs with:
    
- Angular v9.1.4
- Electron v8.2.5
- Electron Builder v22.6.0

With this config, you can :

- Run flipper in a local development environment with Electron & Hot reload
- Run flipper in a production environment
- Package flipper into an executable file for Linux, Windows & Mac

/!\ Angular 8.x or Later CLI needs Node v10.16.3 to work.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository locally :

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/maximegris/angular-electron.git
```

Install dependencies with npm :

``` bash
npm install
```


## To build for development
``` bash
 npm run start
```
Voila! Flipper start with hot reload !

The application code is managed by `main.ts`. In this sample, the app runs with a simple Angular App (http://localhost:4200) and an Electron window.
The Angular component contains an example of Electron and NodeJS native lib import.
You can disable "Developer Tools" by commenting `win.webContents.openDevTools();` in `main.ts`.

## Included Commands

|Command|Description|
|--|--|
|`npm run ng:serve:web`| Execute the app in the browser |
|`npm run build`| Build the app. Your built files are in the /dist folder. |
|`npm run build:prod`| Build the app with Angular aot. Your built files are in the /dist folder. |
|`npm run electron:local`| Builds flipperlication and start electron
|`npm run electron:linux`| Builds flipperlication and creates an app consumable on linux system |
|`npm run electron:windows`| On a Windows OS, builds flipperlication and creates an app consumable in windows 32/64 bit systems |
|`npm run electron:mac`|  On a MAC OS, builds flipperlication and generates a `.app` file of flipperlication that can be run on Mac |

**flipperlication is optimised. Only /dist folder and node dependencies are included in the executable.**

## You want to use a specific lib (like rxjs) in electron main thread ?

YES! You can do it! Just by importing your library in npm dependencies section (not **devDependencies**) with `npm install --save`. It will be loaded by electron during build phase and added to your final package. Then use your library by importing it in `main.ts` file. Quite simple, isn't it ?

## Browser mode

Maybe you want to execute the application in the browser with hot reload ? You can do it with `npm run ng:serve:web`.
**Note that you can't use Electron or NodeJS native libraries in this case.** Please check `providers/electron.service.ts` to watch how conditional import of electron/Native libraries is done.

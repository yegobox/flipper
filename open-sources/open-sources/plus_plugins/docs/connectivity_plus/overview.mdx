## Connectivity Plus Overview

Connectivity plus is Flutter plugin that allows your apps to get information about
the network connectivity of the device, whether it's running on cellular or WiFi,
and if it has an internet connection or not.

:::note
Connectivity plus is going to replace the [original Connectivity plugin](https://pub.dev/packages/connectivity),
if you have been using it, it's better to switch to this one.

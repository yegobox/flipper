## Android Intent Plus Overview

This plugin allows Flutter apps to launch arbitrary intents when the platform
is Android. If the plugin is invoked on iOS, it will crash your app. In checked
mode, we assert that the platform should be Android.

### Get started

#### 1. Add it to your project

```yaml {4} title="pubspec.yaml"
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  android_intent_plus: "^{{ plugins.android_intent_plus }}"
```

#### 2. Download dependency

```bash
$ flutter pub get
```

#### 3. Rebuild the app

```bash
$ flutter run
```

### Next steps
